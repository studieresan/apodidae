The company is one of Europe's leading software companies and has a strong presence in the nordic region, empowering people and businesses through technology.\n\nAt the event, Studs got to learn about what it's like to work at Visma and what possibilities the company offers for someone who wants to work with ground-breaking technology. We got to hear both from Visma's software engineers and their trainees about what their experiences with Visma had been and why they chose Visma as their employer.\n\nLater at the event we had what Visma calls a \"hackasprint\", a short but productive session in which we got to experience what working at Visma was like! A dataset was given to each group, from which the group had to propose a solution to a question that a customer who uses Visma's services might have. This solution had to be presented by picking out the relevant data from the given dataset with Google BigQuery. The group who presented the best solutions according to Visma were given Fitbits! Hopefully the winners of the \"hackasprint\" will start \"sprinting\" on their own üòâ\n\nThe evening was finished with a Scavenger Hunt, a short game involving 10 riddles where we once again tested our group collaboration skills. Perhaps not representative of what you do while working at Visma, but challenging and fun nonetheless!\n\nWe at Studs thought this was an amazing event with a great mix of work and play. Thank you for hosting us, Visma!\n",

Mpya is an IT consulting company that started roughly three years ago, and today they have grown to 54 employees. The key value that separates Mpya from other similar consultant agencies is their focus on authenticity.\n\nThey believe authenticity, which in their own words is to focus on your feelings and being brave enough to speak up about those feelings. With this focus on authenticity, they have also chosen to have no hierarchy in their company - no bosses or titles. Mpya believes that the key to work is self management, and together with the authentic principles they abide after, they achieve a neutral climate where no one has a higher social status than your own, and where you can always speak up.\n\nDuring the evening we learned about how authentic leadership comes into play and what it means to the consultants at Mpya. We split into groups where we reflected on our strengths and weaknesses and got the chance to practice giving positive feedback to each other, or in other words, practice being authentic to each other. Oh, and did we mention that we got some really tasty food as well? Thank you @mpyadigital for a great event!\n",

The hangout began with a brief discussion about Goldman Sachs place in the world, and we later dove deeper into the technical architectures that they employ at GS.\n\n\nA big focus was their *Data Lake* - a centralised storage unit at GS (after all, the company stores a lot of data). The tech wizards at the company work with maintaining, optimising and improving this storage unit. There are many challenges with doing this, one of them being able to retrieve data quickly when you have many data samples to search in.  Even though you are working for a fintech company you might never really encounter the financial part of it, some employees said while laughing.\n\n\nAfter the tech discussions, we had some shorter discussions about the financial aspect of the company. Some might say that we even got a glimpse of how the weather can control the stock market. \n\n\nWe finished the evening with some chats with the employees.\n\n\nWe had a great time! Thanks to GS for hosting this event :)\n",

Moreover, they have exclusive opportunities for students who wish to write their master‚Äôs thesis with them and even offer part time jobs to students during their studies. \n\nStuds got to enjoy a fantastic digital event with Topgolf and some of their employees, including several familiar faces and Studs alumni. After getting to know all about Topgolf and Toptracer, all of our remaining questions were answered in smaller groups with the different team leaders. We got to learn all about how the different teams work, what technologies they use and what each team member is passionate about. To our surprise, many of the employees were not engaged golf players, although many seem to develop a great interest once working there. \n\n",

We also got a glimpse of the process and with what technologies SVT‚Äôs application for kids, Bolibompa, is being developed. During a short break, we got to do some physical exercises, led by the personal trainer at the company, and learned about the importance of stretching a few times during your workday. After the refreshing break activity, the Studs members continued to learn about the impressive work at SVT. The event was wrapped up by gathering all members of Studs in one meeting once again, to receive some encouraging words from the employees at SVT.",

Populum‚Äôs product collects data, in the form of employee experiences, at the customer company, after which the data is then anonymously presented in three automated layers. At the helicopter layer, one can learn what part of the organization needs resources by looking at data from all teams. At the team dialogue layer, the team leaders can learn how to improve their teams. Finally, at the individual layer, individuals can see the history of their personal experience. Populum also feeds all the data back to the customer company, where it can be used by the executives to make important decisions about the company‚Äôs future.\n\nThe digital event with Populum began with a presentation about the company‚Äôs journey by the CEO. We could tell that he was passionate about the product and proud that Populum has landed large and well-known companies as customers over a short period of time. He put much emphasis on their culture, that consists of four main pillars (trust, caring, simple, exceed expectations), which both reflect externally to the customers and internally at the workplace. After the presentation, Studs were divided into digital rooms where we got to learn from different employees about the code stack, common reasons startups fail and AI projects at Populum.

All services provided by Startuplifers are free of charge and they even pay for the visa and flight tickets. The process of getting a job through Startuplifers consists of four main steps. First, students check the open positions on their website and submit a brief application. Startuplifers will then conduct an initial interview with candidates that match the role description, help them improve their resumes and prepare them for the introduction to the company and role of interest. The third step is an interview with the startup, and if both sides want to advance, the fourth and final step is for Startuplifers to take care of the visa, flight tickets and other legal matters. The goal for Startuplifers is to help students and graduates find the confidence to create world-changing innovations.\n\nStuds met with Startuplifers, through their very first online event, through Zoom. The event began with a presentation of the company and continued with a Startuplifers alumnus‚Äô interesting success story. He told us about his experiences in Silicon Valley as well as the experience of returning to Finland, where he remains an active member of the tech community.

By his side were both current members of Studs, as well as  Studs alumni, welcoming us to their office. Sellpy‚Äôs Stockholm warehouse, which additionally holds their headquarters, is located in the city‚Äôs east, in close proximity to the ocean. There, we enjoyed a delicious dinner and later got to follow the selling process of items we brought along with us to advertise on Sellpy. Once settled, we learnt a bit about Sellpy‚Äôs history, progress and its goals for the future. Sellpy aims to change the way we do our shopping and wants to enable circular consuming for everyone. Circular consuming is the idea to reuse, repurpose or recycle used clothes and other products. As of now Sellpy has given more than 10 Million products a second chance and their 450 000 users seem thrilled to continue the trend. \n\nSellpy is not only Sweden‚Äôs largest second hand online market, but it also seems like a fantastic place to work. Sellpy‚Äôs employees are young and the work environment highly dynamic. Their work mentality is simple - Move fast, break things. At Sellpy, one is encouraged to try new things and to take on responsibilities continuously. On top of that, the company is devoted to their employees‚Äô skill development and knowledge sharing, every other week they all get together for a course, personal reflections or similar efforts. After talking to the employees it strikes us that what motivates them is their confidence in the product and willingness to support its cause. If this has made you as curious as us about Sellpy, apply for one of their positions! They aspire to employ developers in both full time and part time positions and encourage students to write thesis projects with them. \n",

Funnel was founded in 2014 and aims to facilitate the overview of data that comes from different marketing tools, such as Google Analytics and Facebook Ads. They do this by providing their customers with business-ready data from the existing tools, to the destination of the customers‚Äô choice. For example, customers can view their gathered data in Google spreadsheet, business intelligence systems or create dashboards with it in Funnels own application. The result is that marketers are able to effortlessly determine whether their marketing strategies are profitable. Funnel is a flat organisation, where everyone takes responsibility for the success of the company. They work in teams of 3-4 developers with special focus areas and practice continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) to enable the products to be regularly upgraded and improved. Funnel does not advertise summer jobs or master theses within software technology, however, they are open for suggestions and welcome emails on the matter. They are also continuously recruiting for full time positions, which are advertised on their website.\n\nStuds were invited to Funnels office, only a few steps away from T-Centralen in Stockholm. There, we enjoyed an impressive dinner - homemade pizza, baked on the spot by a professional chef. After a presentation of the company, we got to participate in a workshop where we practiced mob programming on small programming tasks. The focus of the exercise was to make sure that everyone was able to understand the solution and to practice the roles of navigator versus driver. The night was wrapped up with some mingling with the employees, where the members of Studs got the chance to ask more questions about Funnel.",

The other presentation was about one of the, yet to be announced, machine learning (ML) projects that Findwise has been working on for another company. Unlike other companies offering ML solutions, Findwise does not promise their clients unachievable results. Instead, they present the results they have obtained after the first phase, from where the company can take a stand on whether they would like to continue the project or not.

Today, they have an app, available for smartphones and tablets, where users can meet licensed doctors and psychologists through video calls available in multiple countries around Europe. This means that in many cases, patients do not need to leave their homes to get help. If the doctor considers a patient to need further examination, they will be sent to one of the labs that Kry collaborates with, to take the necessary tests. Thanks to another collaboration, prescription drugs can also be ordered home to the patient by bicycle couriers. Another advantage over the traditional health care, made possible through the app, is matching the right patient to the right doctor. Most of the doctors working at Kry have some type of specialization and given that the patients specify their symptoms when starting a video call, Kry is able to match patients to the most suitable doctor for the case.\n\nStuds was invited to a wonderful evening at Kry‚Äôs Stockholm office, where we saw a lot of familiar faces from the computer science chapter at KTH.

Digpro software facilitates handling geographical data in such systems, and thus the ability to track what‚Äôs going on across the system. Digpro is well-established in the industry, having existed there for over 30 years, and has clients such as ABB and E.ON both in Sweden and abroad. \n\n**Working at Digpro**\n\nDigpro works closely with ‚Äòclassic‚Äô engineering disciplines and the software has a discernible impact on society and communities where it is in use. Engineers at Digpro work on constantly improving and upgrading their systems, as well as make sure that their deployed systems are working without fault. Downtime in their client‚Äôs infrastructure can quickly affect thousands of people, so their systems need to be reliable. Therefore, Digpro runs tests continuously with a very rigid QA process, which everyone in the office can see the status of. This makes everyone feel involved in the development process, and we got the impression that everyone feels ownership of the Digpro products. \n\n**The event**\n\nOur visit to Digpro allowed us to get to know the company. We heard from both managers and developers about the work processes and the company at large and received a detailed presentation from the HR department on what life at Digpro is like. We were also introduced to the quality assurance methods and tools in use, which were interesting to see in action. The event closed with some informal fun and games together with the employees that had welcomed us.\n",

Epidemic Sound‚Äôs offices on S√∂dermalm in Stockholm are homey and stylish, with the top floor doubling as a stage area for smaller gigs.

The goal is to collect savings, loans, and investments from different banks into one easy to understand interface to help the consumer get an overview and make informed decisions.

The market, especially the banks, were at first skeptical to Tinks concept, however, after winning over the skepticism in Sweden, Tink has now expanded into other markets in Europe and are growing fast to make an impact on the European market. Tink also provides an API for other developers to integrate with, in order to further spread the use of their software.\n\n**Working at Tink**\n\nDevelopers at Tink not only create and maintain their own app, but a large part of the work consists of mining banks for information and reverse engineering the bank‚Äôs interface in order to include it into Tink, as banks rarely volunteer this information. Tink‚Äôs employees are faced with the constant challenge of staying a step ahead, and the environment is fast-paced and rewarding. Employees tell us that they enjoy the tempo and that the environment of talented people is a great place to grow and learn from each other.\n\n**The event**\n\nSecurity is a big concern at Tink, as they are handling people‚Äôs personal finances and bank data.

		"publicDescription": "\n**About KRY**\n\nFrom humble beginnings in 2014, KRY today employs more than 600 people in offices across western Europe. KRY‚Äôs founders had a goal - to improve and effectivize health care by shortening the route between doctor and patient. KRY is an app in which patients can ‚Äúmeet‚Äù with a doctor or psychologist through video calls, replacing the initial contact at district care centers. By being active participants in talks in both politics and the healthcare industry Kry has paved the way for e-healthcare services in Sweden, integrating well with other care providers and expanding the health care offerings available to the Swedish population. KRY is in an ongoing expansion to other countries in western Europe, with interesting challenges in understanding and adapting to the countries‚Äô laws and different health care systems. \n\n**Working at KRY**\n\nKRY‚Äôs crew is a young and ambitious one, and they all seem hungry to learn and thrive in a truly interdisciplinary environment. KRY‚Äôs teams mix tech-savvy engineers with knowledgeable medical professionals. The focus on health and well-being is clearly not only their market offering but a passion in the office as well. The employees welcoming us at the event tell of open seminars from co-workers of different disciplines, at-work wellness activities, and a strong learning culture. The doctors in attendance seem eager to learn and understand IT and how to include it in their tasks, and the engineers seem proud that their job contributes to society in such a tangible way.\n\n**The event**\n\nKRY welcomed us to their light and cozy headquarters in Stockholm. The premises were a hip mix of offices, meeting rooms, video-conference rooms, and social areas where collaboration and team meetings have a solid place. After dinner with a large group of employees, both tech and medical, we learned more about KRY. First, there was a short presentation and later we mingled with the KRY staff who were more than happy to share the joy of their workplace\n",

It began with a presentation about the company accompanied by good food. Then there were three short presentations in smaller groups one for Summer Internship, one for their Management Trainee Program and lastly one about the career journey at Visma, all held by employees that had had that particular experience at Visma, which gave us the chance to get a more personal look into the company and ask questions. Lastly, we were presented with a short business case to discuss and solve in groups of 5-6 people which gave a better view into the types of problems Visma aims to solve for their clients, and the types of questions Visma employees might encounter.\n",

As SEB employees told us at the event, the financial world is going through a maelstrom of change, and there has been more development in the last 10 years than in the preceding 200. Banking is being redefined as we speak, and SEB is determined to be a part of those changes.\n\n**Working at SEB**\n\nSEB has taken a step forward from the traditional image of banking, and working in tech at SEB today means working in an innovative and relatively fast-paced environment. SEB is no start-up, but there still seems to be space for flexibility within the processes necessary in such a colossal company.\nSEB told us of several routes into the company for a recent graduate, most notably the tech programme spanning over 6 months, or the trainee programme spanning over 9 months.\n\n**The event**\n\nAt the Studs event SEB had prepared some mini-lectures on hot areas of computer sciences, held by senior SEB employees working in the respective fields. The topics on the agenda were artificial intelligence, big data, and cybersecurity, and in each area we were introduced to what is currently happening in banking that impacts the field, and how SEB works with each technology today towards possible new solutions in the future.\nWe were also treated to a more general lecture of the current and future challenges SEB is facing, with a very interesting introduction to the role of banking in society as trust agents, how current developments interact with this role, and how SEB aims to adapt to lead the way into a next generation of banking.\n",

That‚Äôs why they arrange and encourage all kinds of activities for colleagues to bond, and why they could be impressively transparent about any questions we had for them.\n\n**The event**\n\nWe were welcomed at Cygni‚Äôs offices by a group of friendly people and a short introduction to Cygni‚Äôs business and available career options. We soon moved on to a very informative presentation on the practicalities of going from student life into the work force. This presentation from Cygni Stockholm‚Äôs CEO covered a bunch of important topics on what to consider from potential employers apart from salary: benefits, culture, social responsibility, off-work activities and events, continued learning and more. Coincidentally all things that Cygni does well and values.\nWe appreciated these insights a lot as they are hard to come by either in school or on regular company events. The rest of the evening was spent hanging out and chatting to consultants at Cygni about both work and play at Cygni and time flew by.\n",

The business idea fell perfectly in a previously undeveloped niche and Sellpy has since their start in 2014 grown to employing over 300 people and finding new owners for more than 5 000 000 items. Sellpy performs nearly all parts of the process themselves, managing everything from parcel collection to delivery to the buyer, and every step of the process is facilitated or automated using tech.

They have more than 500 customers worldwide and reach around 220 million unique monthly viewers, meaning they manage over 1.2 billion video ads per month. Their headquarters are located in Silicon Valley, and they have offices worldwide, across North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. \n\nSince Ooyala manages ads for such huge amounts of viewers, they must build a high-performance system that can handle operations all over the world. With a system that has the capacity of managing over 120 000 requests per second, Ooyala works with innovative technology that can be developed to meet these high demands. One big challenge for Ooyala is that they must outsmart the ad blockers in web browsers, to make sure that the ads actually reach the intended viewers. Their systems must also predict deliveries for each unique viewer, such that the appropriate ad is shown at the exact right moment. This means Ooyala has a high demand for creating intelligent solutions that can solve complex problems.\n\nAt the event, the Studs team was given an insight to the company‚Äôs business and their history, from being a small start-up in 2007 that grew into the well established, rapidly expanding company they are now. The main event of the evening was a programming challenge for creating the smartest Dice Wars AI-bot.

The talk was followed by a tour of their newly finished office and a laid-back dinner with some of the company‚Äôs employees from different departments. We then got a chance to hang out and get to know them over a game of pool or darts, or just a casual beer in the office lounge. The event at the offices then concluded with a hot mug of gl√∂gg on their rooftop with a spectacular view of Stockholm.\n\nAs graduating students in computer science related fields, we were encouraged to reach out to TriOptima with our own suggestions for interesting collaborative projects. We felt that despite acting in a very complex business area and enjoying a very fast growth, TriOptima is a company which has maintained their sense of familiarity. Their efforts to provide a work environment that is encouraging and inclusive is something we at Studs value. After concluding the event with a trip by party bus to the TriOptima sponsored pub, we were left with the impression of working at TriOptima being both exciting and approachable.",
